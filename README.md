# ArrayViews.jl

A Julia package to explore a new system of array views.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lindahua/ArrayViews.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lindahua/ArrayViews.jl)

-----------------------------

## Main Features

- An efficient ``view`` function that implements array views
- Support of arrays of arbitrary dimension and arbitrary combinations of indexers
- Support view composition (*i.e.* construct views over views)
- Special attention to ensure type stability in most cases
- Efficient indexing (both cartesian and linear)
- Light weight view construction
- A systematic approach to detect contiguous views (statically)
- Views work with linear algebra functions

## Overview

The key function in this package is ``view``. This function is similar to ``sub`` in Julia Base, except that it returns an view instance with more efficient representation:

```julia
a = rand(4, 5, 6)

view(a, :)
view(a, :, 2)
view(a, 1:2, 1:2:5, 4)
view(a, 2, :, 3:6)
```

The ``@view`` macro can be used to convert an array indexed with square bracket syntax to a call to the `view` function. For example, ``@view(a[:, 2])`` translates to ``view(a, :, 2)``.

The ``view`` function returns a view of type ``ArrayView``. Here, ``ArrayView`` is an abstract type with two derived types (``ContiguousView`` and ``StridedView``), defined as:

```julia
abstract ArrayView{T,N,M} <: DenseArray{T,N}
```
We can see that each view type has three static properties: element type ``T``, the number of dimensions ``N``, and the *contiguous rank* ``M``. 

#### Contiguous Rank

The *contiguous rank* plays an important role in determining (statically) the contiguousness of a subview. Below are illustrations of 2D views respective with contiguous rank ``0``, ``1``, and ``2``.

**2D View with contiguous rank 0**

```
* * * * * * 
. . . . . .
* * * * * *
. . . . . . 
* * * * * *
. . . . . .
```
Here, ``*`` indicates a position covered by the view, and ``.`` otherwise. We can see that the columns are not contiguous.

**2D View with contiguous rank 1**

```
* * * * * * 
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
```
We can see that each column is contiguous, while the entire view is not.


**2D View with contiguous rank 2**

```
* * * * * * 
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
```
The entire 2D view is contiguous.


Formally, when ``v`` is a view with contiguous rank ``M``, then ``view(v, :, :, ..., :, 1)`` must be contiguous when the number of colons is less than or equal to ``M``.


#### View Types

The package has two view types ``ContiguousView`` and ``StridedView`` (both are sub types of ``ArrayView``). They are respectively defined as follows:

- ``ContiguousView`` is used to represent a view of an array (or a part of an array) that has contiguous memory layout:

    ```julia
    immutable ContiguousView{T,N,Arr<:Array{T}} <: ArrayView{T,N,N}
        arr::Arr               # underlying array
        offset::Int            # offset relative to the arr's origin
        len::Int               # number of elements
        shp::NTuple{N,Int}     # view shape
    end
    ```
    Here, ``T`` is the element type, ``N`` is the number of dimensions, and ``Arr`` is the type of the underlying array. Obviously, the contiguous rank of a contiguous view is ``N``. 


- ``StridedView`` is used to represent a view of an array (or a part of an array) that is not necessarily contiguous (*i.e.*, the contiguousness cannot be determined statically).

    ```julia
    immutable StridedView{T,N,M,Arr<:Array{T}} <: ArrayView{T,N,M}
        arr::Arr                  # underlying array
        offset::Int               # offset relative to arr's origin
        len::Int                  # number of elements
        shp::NTuple{N,Int}        # view shape
        strides::NTuple{N,Int}    # strides of all dimensions
    end
    ```
    Here, ``M`` is the contiguous rank. 


#### View Types in Action

The following example illustrates how contiguous rank is used to determine view types in practice.

```julia
a = rand(m, n)

v0 = view(a, :)         # of type ContiguousView{Float64, 1}

u1 = view(a, a:b, :)    # of type StridedView{Float64, 2, 1}
u2 = view(u1, :, i)     # of type ContiguousView{Float64, 1}

v1 = view(a, a:2:b, :)  # of type StridedView{Float64, 2, 0}
v2 = view(v1, :, i)     # of type StridedView{Float64, 1, 0} 
```

Four kinds of indexers are supported, integer, range (*e.g.* ``a:b``), stepped range (*e.g.* ``a:b:c``), and colon (*i.e.*, ``:``). 
Unlike the ``sub`` function in Julia Base, the colon ``:`` is specially treated rather than converted to ``1:size(v,d)``, as it plays a crucial role in determining contiguousness. For example, the contiguous rank of ``view(a, :, a:b)`` is 2, while that of ``view(a, i:j, a:b)`` is 1.



## View Construction

The procedure of constructing a view consists of several steps:

1. Compute the shape of a view. This is done by an internal function ``vshape``.

2. Compute the offset of a view. This is done by an internal function ``aoffset``. The computation is based on the following formula:

    ```
    offset(v(I1, I2, ..., Im)) = (first(I1) - 1) * stride(v, 1) 
                               + (first(I2) - 1) * stride(v, 2)
                               + ...
                               + (first(Im) - 1) * stride(v, m)
    ```

3. Compute the contiguous rank, based on both view shape and the combination of indexer types. A type ``ContRank{M}`` is introduced for static computation of contiguous rank (please refer to ``src/contrank.jl`` for details). 

4. Construct a view, where the view type is determined by both the number of dimensions and the value of contiguous rank (which is determined statically).
   
For runtime efficiency, specialized methods of these functions are implemented for views of 1D, 2D, and 3D. These methods are extensively tested.
